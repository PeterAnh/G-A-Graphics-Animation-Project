<p>Your project part 1 has 60 marks and will be assessed on correctness of the functionalities and coding (structure, clarity and appropriate use of OpenGL). Tasks A to I carry 5 marks each. Task J carries 5+5 marks for the two additional functionalities each student is required to implement. The last 5 marks are researved for the report. This equals the 60 marks allocated to part 1. You can get upto 5 bonus marks by optionally completing task K.</p>
<p>Specific tasks that your scene editor should implement
Your scene editor needs to implement all the functionality described in the items A to J below (and optionally item K as well if you want to get some bonus marks). Some demonstration and explanation will be given in a lecture. Please view the lecture recording if you miss that lecture. Please also view messages/announcement on help3003 during the project weeks.</p>
<p>Don't panic if the videos provided alongside the items seem beyond what we've done in the labs. The project tasks have been chosen to cover all the relevant concepts without requiring you to implement too much extra. Thus, much of the functionality is already implemented in the skeleton code, and some of the tasks require similar code to what is in the skeleton code.</p>
<p>Also, you are allowed to improve upon the specification and implement some items differently, but you should explain in your report why it is an improvement.</p>
<p>Although the videos don't have any audio, all the mouse actions were captured in the videos. We suggest that you view each video in full screen mode carefully. Please pay attention to the mouse icon shown inside the window.
When the circle next to the mouse icon turns into red, it indicates that the left mouse button is held down.
When the circle becomes green, it indicates that the middle mouse button is held down. When the wheel of the middle mouse button is rolled, you should see an arrow and its direction.
The right mouse button is reserved for bringing up the menu.
For your convenience, you can download the Zip file <a href="http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS3003/laboratories/project-common/project1-videos.zip" rel="nofollow">87MB</a> of all the videos below.
You can also download a movie file (including audio) <a href="http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS3003/laboratories/project-common/project-demo.mov.gz" rel="nofollow">252MB</a> (when unzipped, it would come to approximately 260MB) that explains about the camera's position, viewing direction, and some basic mouse events.
The skeleton code draws the ground, an initial mesh object and a sphere showing the position of a single point light source; however, it has the camera always facing the same way. You can move it forwards and backwards using the scroll wheel, via the viewDist variable, but there's no way to move it otherwise. You should fix this problem in the code. The variables camRotUpAndOverDeg and camRotSidewaysDeg are already set appropriately when moving the mouse with the left button down, or the middle button down (or shift + left button). Modify the display function so that the camera rotates around the centre point according to these variables, in the same way as the sample solution shown in the video below.</p>

<p><input type="checkbox" id="" disabled="" class="task-list-item-checkbox" checked=""> <strong>Task A:</strong><br>
<del>Your scene editor should do the following:
When the left mouse button is held down and dragged horizontally across the window, it should rotate the scene about the axis that is vertical to the ground plane.
When the left mouse button is held down and dragged vertically up (or down) in the window, it should zoom into (or out of) the scene.
Dragging the middle mouse button horizontally is the same as dragging the left button horizontally.
Dragging the middle mouse button vertically up (or down) across the window should change the elevation angle of the camera looking at the ground plane. Correspondingly, this tilts the entire scene up (or down).</del></p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Task B:</strong><br>
Similarly, changing the location and scale of objects is already implemented, via the loc and scale members of the SceneObject structure, which is stored in the variable sceneObjs for each object in the scene. However, the angles array in this structure doesn't affect what's drawn, even though it is appropriately set to contain the rotations around the X, Y and Z axes, in degrees. Modify the drawMesh function so that it appropriately rotates the object when drawing it in the same way as the sample solution.
Note: The skeleton code also moves objects in different directions compared to the sample solution -- you should also fix this (Hint: there is more than one way to do this).</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Vg0UOkO9Dok" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/504e82eaf52b285747725ce3e471d547527f5480/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f566730554f6b4f39446f6b2f736464656661756c742e6a7067" alt="Task B" data-canonical-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vg0UOkO9Dok/sddefault.jpg" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>
<p>As shown in the video, your scene editor should do the following:
Dragging the left mouse button vertically across the window should rotate the current object about the x-axis (parallel to the ground plane and pointing to the right).
Dragging the middle mouse button horizontally across the window should rotate the current object about the z-axis (parallel to the ground plane and pointing out of the screen).
Dragging the left mouse button horizontally across the window should rotate the current object about the y-axis (vertical to the ground plane).
Dragging the middle mouse button vertically across the window should change the texture scale on the object.</p>
<p>Sometimes two of the rotations go the same way, as in the video below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Task C:</strong><br>
Implement a menu item for adjusting the amounts of ambient, diffuse and specular light, as well as the amount of shine. Recall that the shine value needs to be able to increase to about 100 or so. Modify the materialMenu and makeMenuM functions so that they change the appropriate members of the SceneObject structure. The code to use these to affect the shading via the calculation for the light is already implemented in the skeleton code provided.
Follow the corresponding implementations of other similar menu items. Use the setToolCallbacks function which has four arguments which are pointers to four float's that should be modified when moving the mouse in the x and y directions while pressing the left button or the middle button (or shift + left button). After each callback function accepting a pair of (x,y) relative movements is a 2Ã—2 matrix which can be used to scale and rotate the effect of the mouse movement vector. See the calls to setToolCallbacks in scene-start.cpp for example. The setToolCallbacks function is defined in gnatidread.h.</p>
<p>The sample video shows that
the ambient or diffuse light of the object can be interactively changed by dragging the left mouse button horizontally or vertically;
the specular light and amount of shine can be interactively adjusted by dragging the middle mouse button horizontally or vertically.
the position of the light source can be modified by dragging the mouse button. For this functionality, you are suggested to use
the left mouse button for changing the x- and z-coordinates
the middle mouse button for changing the y-coordinates
of the light source's position</p>

<li class="task-list-item">
<p><input type="checkbox" id="" disabled="" class="task-list-item-checkbox" checked=""> <strong>Task D:</strong><br>
<del>In the skeleton code, triangles are "clipped" (not displayed) if they are even slightly close to the camera. Fix the reshape callback function so that the camera can give more "close up" views of objects.</del> Done! <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="laughing" fallback-src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f606.png">ðŸ˜†</g-emoji></p>

<p><input type="checkbox" id="" disabled="" class="task-list-item-checkbox" checked=""> <strong>Task E:</strong><br>
<del>Also modify the reshape function, so that it behaves differently when the width is less than the height: basically whatever is visible when the window is square should continue to be visible as the width is decreased, similar to what happens if the window height is decreased starting with a square. </del> Done! <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="laughing" fallback-src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f606.png">ðŸ˜†</g-emoji></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Task F:</strong><br>
Modify the vertex shader so that the light reduces with distance - exactly how it reduces is up to you, but you should aim for the reduction to be noticeable without quickly becoming very dark, similar to the sample solution. This should apply to the first light, but the video shows a slightly different implementation so the second light was chosen from the menu to demonstrate the concept. Also, you should implement the next item first to see whether the ground plane is correctly lit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Task G:</strong><br>
Move the main lighting calculations into the fragment shader, so that the directions are calculated for individual fragments rather than for the vertices. This should have a very noticeable effect on the way the light interacts with the ground (especially when the ground has a plain texture map), since the ground only has vertices at the corners of a coarse grid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Task H:</strong><br> Generally specular highlights tend towards white rather than the colour of the object. Modify the shader code so that the specular component always shines towards white, regardless of the texture and the colour assigned to the object. Â </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Task I:</strong><br> Add a second light to both the C++ code and the shaders. The second light should be directional, i.e., the direction that the light hits each surface is constant and independent of the position of the surface. In particular, use the direction from the second light's location to the origin as the direction of the light. For example, moving the light source upward should increase the y-component of the direction of the light source, making the light source behave like the mid-day sun. Like the first light source, use sceneObj[2] to store the coordinates and colours of the second light, and make it similar to the first light, including placing a sphere at the coordinates of the light.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Task J:</strong><br> Whether you work alone or with another student, each group member must individually design and implement two small, but non-trivial additional functionality. E.g., (1) allowing objects in the scene to be deleted, or (2) duplicated. (3) Adding a wave motion to the ground or (4) to the scene objects. (5) Adding a spot light to the scene and allowing its illumination direction to be changed interactively. (6) Varying colours over time. (7) Toggling on/off the global coordinate system on the ground. (8) Allowing the user to select another object as the current object. (All of these are acceptable, but towards the simpler end).
Individual's report should clearly describe the additional functionality implemented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Task K:</strong><br> Other additional functionality by the group may earn a small number of bonus marks, but not more than 5 marks. Generally, focusing on other tasks is a better use of your time. E.g., (1) loading and saving scenes, (2) clicking on objects to edit them, (3) setting paths for objects to move along over time, (4) motion under physics, (5) particle effects, (6) attaching one object to another so that they move and rotate together. (These are tougher than above, but also suitable as your individual additional functionality.)</p>
